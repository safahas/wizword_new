# WizWord ðŸŽ¯

WizWord is an AI-powered word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by asking yes/no questions. The game uses advanced AI models to select words and answer questions intelligently.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels and word categories
- AI-powered word selection and question answering
- Fun and Challenge modes with strategic scoring system
- Optional nickname-based leaderboard
- Local and cloud storage support
- Mobile and desktop friendly UI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wizword.git
cd wizword
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# OpenRouter API Configuration
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# AWS Configuration (Optional - for cloud storage)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region  # e.g., us-east-1

# Game Configuration
USE_CLOUD_STORAGE=false  # Set to true to use AWS DynamoDB instead of local storage
```

5. Run the game:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## How to Play

1. Configure your game:
   - Choose word length (3-15 letters)
   - Select a category (General, Animals, Food, etc.)
   - Pick game mode (Fun or Challenge)
   - Enter an optional nickname

2. Game Modes:
   
   ### Fun Mode
   - No scoring system
   - Ask unlimited questions
   - Make multiple guesses
   - Perfect for learning and practice

   ### Challenge Mode
   - Strategic scoring system:
     - Each question: -5 points
     - Wrong guess: -10 points
     - Correct guess: 100 points per word
     - Question penalty: Number of questions Ã— 5
     - Final points = max(Base points - Question penalty, 10)
   - Higher scores are better!
   - Be strategic with your questions to minimize penalties

3. Asking Questions:
   - Questions must be yes/no format (start with Is, Are, Does, etc.)
   - Questions must end with a question mark
   - Examples:
     - "Is it a type of food?"
     - "Does it contain the letter 'a'?"
     - "Is it something you can find at home?"
     - "Would you use this daily?"

4. Making Guesses:
   - Type your guess when ready
   - Guesses must match the chosen word length
   - In Challenge mode:
     - Wrong guesses cost 10 points
     - Correct guesses always earn 100 points per word
     - Try to minimize questions to maximize your score!

## Score Efficiency Index (SEI)
SEI is a performance metric that combines your average score per word and your average time per word:

    SEI = (Average Score per Word) / (Average Time per Word in seconds)

- A higher SEI means you are both fast and accurate.
- The global leaderboard ranks users by their highest SEI in any single game.
- SEI is shown on your share card and in your statistics graphs.

## Favorite Category

Your **Favorite Category** is the word category (such as Tech, Brands, Science, etc.) in which you have played the most games. The app tracks all your games and determines which category you play most frequently. This is shown in your stats sidebar as:

    Favorite Category: Tech

This helps you quickly see which type of words you enjoy or play the most!

## Game Statistics & Performance Graphs

After each game, WizWord provides detailed performance statistics and visualizations:

### 1. Score & Time Trend Graph
- **Graph Title:** Avg Score/Word & Avg Time/Word Trend (Last 12 Months)
- **X-Axis:**
  - Nonlinear: First 11 months are compressed (one point per month, averaged), last month is expanded (each game in the last month is shown as an individual point, labeled by date).
- **Left Y-Axis:** Average Score per Word (total score divided by number of words for each game)
- **Right Y-Axis:** Average Time per Word (seconds)
  - For Beat mode: time for the game divided by number of words solved
  - For other modes: time for the game
  - Scale: 0â€“300 seconds
- **Legend:** Both lines are shown with different colors and a shared legend.
- **Details:**
  - The graph visually emphasizes recent performance by expanding the last monthâ€™s results.
  - Each game in the last month is labeled with its actual date (YYYY-MM-DD).

### 2. Avg Time per Word vs. Cumulative Time
- **X-Axis:** Cumulative time (seconds) across all games/words played
- **Y-Axis:** Average time per word (seconds)
- **Purpose:** Shows how your speed per word changes as you play more games.

### 3. Beat Mode Aggregation
- In Beat mode, statistics are aggregated for the entire session:
  - **Total Points:** Sum of all points earned across all words in the session
  - **Guesses Made:** Total number of guesses across all words in the session
  - **Words Played:** List of all words solved in the session
  - **Session Duration:** Total time spent in the session

### 4. Leaderboard & Historical Stats
- The leaderboard and your historical stats are based on these aggregated and per-game statistics.

## Cloud Deployment

To enable cloud storage with AWS:

1. Create a DynamoDB table named `word_guess_games` with primary key `session_id`
2. Set up AWS credentials in your `.env` file
3. Set `USE_CLOUD_STORAGE=true` in your `.env` file

## Development

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

## UI Configuration

- WIZWORD_STICKY_BANNER (default: true)
  - Controls whether the in-game WizWord banner (score/timer strip) stays fixed at the top or scrolls with the page.
  - Accepted truthy values: `true`, `1`, `yes`, `on`
  - Accepted falsy values: `false`, `0`, `no`, `off`
  - Example (in `.env`):
    ```env
    WIZWORD_STICKY_BANNER=true
    ```
  - After changing this value, restart Streamlit.

## Admin Dashboard Counters

WizWord maintains lightweight global counters for basic platform stats, stored in a separate JSON file.

- File location: `game_data/global_counters.json`
  - Override with env var `GLOBAL_COUNTERS_PATH` if you need a custom path.
  - The app will auto-create the file and its parent directory if missing.

- Tracked counters:
  - `users_count`: total registered users (increments on successful registration)
  - `total_game_time_seconds`: cumulative game time across all saved games (adds each gameâ€™s `time_taken`/`duration`)
  - `total_sessions`: total sessions started (increments when a new Beat game is instantiated)

- Viewing counters (Admin only):
  - Log in as an admin user; the sidebar shows three metrics:
    - Users
    - Global Game Time (HHh MMm)
    - Total Sessions

- Example env configuration:
  ```env
  GLOBAL_COUNTERS_PATH=game_data/global_counters.json
  ```
