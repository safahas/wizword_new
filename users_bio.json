I build Python, Django, FastAPI, and React applications, focusing on cybersecurity, networking, and cloud systems at Juniper Networks and a local startup incubator. I mentor students at a robotics club and volunteer at the public library. I enjoy hiking in Almaden Quicksilver, trail running at Los Gatos Creek, and cycling to Santa Cruz. On weekends I practice photography, astronomy with a backyard telescope, and cooking Mediterranean dishes; I also roast coffee and garden tomatoes, basil, and citrus. I follow soccer and basketball and support the Earthquakes and Warriors. I travel to Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, and New York for conferences. My family—partner Lina and kids Maya and Omar—join me for camping in Yosemite and Big Sur. I contribute to open‑source, write tech blogs, and present at meetups on APIs, data science, LLMs, and prompt engineering.",
